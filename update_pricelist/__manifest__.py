Update Pricelist
================

Update the prices of many products on a pricelist at once, either by a fixed
amount or by a percentage of their current price — without editing each
pricelist line by hand.

Features
--------

* **Bulk update wizard** launched from three places:

  * Product Variants list (selected variants)
  * Product Templates list (all their variants)
  * Pricelist Items list (selected lines, one pricelist at a time)

* Increase prices by a **fixed amount** or a **percentage** of the current price.
* Creates new, time-stamped pricelist lines (per-variant rules) and can
  optionally **close the previous open lines** so history is preserved.
* Warns before submitting when selected products have **no current price** on
  the pricelist (a percentage increase would be computed from a base of 0).

Pricelist Items overview
------------------------

A dedicated **Sales → Pricelist Lines** view shows each pricelist line with its
**latest purchase price** (from posted vendor bills), **supplier**, computed
**profit percentage**, and validity dates — with search, filtering on current
prices, and grouping by pricelist.

Usage
-----

#. Open **Sales → Products → Product Variants** (or Pricelist Lines).
#. Select the products/lines to update and click **Update Pricelist**.
#. Choose the pricelist, the update type (Fixed / Percentage) and the amount.
#. Tick **Close Old Pricelists** to end-date the previous lines, then **Submit**.
